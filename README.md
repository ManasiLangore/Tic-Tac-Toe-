# Tic-Tac-Toe


I developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for wins, draws, and allows players to restart after each round.
This was a great hands-on project to practice game logic, UI design, and DOM manipulation (or state management, if React or another framework was used).

ðŸŽ¯ Features:
âœ… Two-player Mode â€“ Players alternate between X and O turns
âœ… Win Detection â€“ The game automatically detects and announces when a player wins
âœ… Draw Detection â€“ If all cells are filled and there's no winner, the game declares a draw
âœ… Game Reset â€“ A restart button lets users play again without refreshing the page
âœ… Visual Feedback â€“ Highlights the winning combination (if implemented)
âœ… Responsive UI â€“ Works well on desktop and mobile (if you used responsive CSS)

ðŸ§° Tech Stack Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
